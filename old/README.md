1. Place all images into a Deep Zoom Composer project.
2. Drag all images onto the canvas in Compose mode.  This will automatically create the necessary image pyramid.
3. Make sure that the background image is at the bottom of the z order (“Send to back” from the context menu).
4. Place the PowerShell script into the same directory where the `.dzprj` file lies.
5. Run the script; it should arrange all images, including the background correctly.
6. Export the project.
